# Psychic-Game

The Psychic-Game is the first game I ever made, so it's very simple, you have to guess the correct keyboard key to get a win and if you miss too many times you get lost. Each time the player wins or loses the correct key randomly changes. Oh and it's good to know that the correct key will always be a letter.
